## Functionality

### Main Board

The main functionality of the main board is to notify the RetroTink 4K of the change and trigger an SVS profile change via serial commands when the selected input on the gSCARTsw changes. This is a hard-coded automated process and does not require user interference.

Please refer to the [RetroTink 4K Wiki](https://consolemods.org/wiki/AV:RetroTINK-4K#Load_Profile) for details on how to set up the SVS profiles.
